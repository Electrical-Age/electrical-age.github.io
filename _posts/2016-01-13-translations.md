Hello, Bonjour, Hallo Electrical-Age players.

<img src="/assets/news/translate-sign.png" alt="Translate sign" style="float:right; width:27%; heigth:auto; margin-left:15px;" />

We rewrote the mod translation system and today we are happy to announce you that the mod will be available in multiple languages soon. The official supported language is English, but translating the mod in your native language is easy. In order to achieve this, we need your help...

We use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/) as localization platform. Create an account and [ask to join the ELN Team on Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/electrical-age/eln/) to translate the mod into your language. No coding skills are required.

Help us to make the Electrical-Age mod even better.

Thank you, the Electrical-Age team.
